## Updates for eclipse phase trivia

I acquired sounds from Joel Owens' [Space 1999 site](http://www.joelowens.org/space1999/sfx.htm).
I inquired if he had a creative commons license and no he did not
have a license, but that I was welcome to use them with his best wishes.
The filenames are renamed with his original filename as the suffix.
